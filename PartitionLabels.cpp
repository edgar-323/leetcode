/*
A string S of lowercase letters is given. 
We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, 
and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

Note:
    S will have length in range [1, 500].
    S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

        // How to define a partition?
        // Well, a partition is a window (i.e., a substr of S).
        // Thus, it has (left, right) pointers.
        // Suppose left = i and right = j?
        // How do we know if (left, right) defines a partition ?
        // This occurrs if all characters in S[left:right] do not
        // appear in S[right+1:N].
        // This means that everytime we increment `right`,
        // we have to scan S[left:right] and check that no character 
        // appears in S[right+1:N]. 
        // This solution can run in O(N^2) in the worst case.
        // Is there a better solution?
        // Consider c = S[i], for some i â‚¬ {0,...,N-1}.
        // Let's define:
        //      last_pos[c] = index of last_occurrence of c in S. 
        //
        // Now we initialize left = right = 0.
        // Let P = last_occurrence[S[0]].
        // We do:
        //      i = 0; 
        //
